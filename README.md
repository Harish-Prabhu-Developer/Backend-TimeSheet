   <p align="justify">In this project, these use Non- Relational Database named MongoDB. Here, each individual 
records are called as Documents and The Group of Documents are called as Collections. A Database 
design is a collection of stored data organized in such way that the data requirements are satisfied by 
the database. The general objective is to make information access easy, quick, inexpensive and 
flexible for the user. There are also some specific objectives like controlled redundancy from failure, 
privacy, security and performance. A group of relative records make up a collection. To design and 
store data to the needed forms database collections are prepared.</p>
